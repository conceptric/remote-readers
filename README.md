# Remote::Xml::Reader

Provide a remote URI, a target XML node name, and this library will parse the sub-tree to a hash.

This is a work in progress, so anything could change without notice. Its designed for use in some of my projects.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'remote-xml-reader'

Or install it yourself as:
